# add-view-google-photos
Working on building an iOS/Swift app that allows for user input to add "tags" that get appended to the description of the selected images and then uploaded to users google photos account. Then also allow for searching and displaying those image back out from the users google photos account.

I have very little programming knowlege and I am slowly piecing this together. Any and all feedback or help on this project is welcome.
